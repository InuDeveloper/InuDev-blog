Hi there, here David. I'm going to explain my experience in MERQA and what is my role in it

# Personal experience in the company & role

MERQA is a dominican startup, seeking to improve the commerce in Dominican Republic. My role as the lead developer is improve code from the developers and help them out fixing bugs and doing meetings.

MERQA is a very new-friendly environment, and when I started, they helped me out and asked me what I can do to improve MERQA.

A quick introduction on how was the interview, the interviewer asked me to fix some bugs that was ocurring at the time in the page, then how I could improve it.
