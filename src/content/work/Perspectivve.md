Hi, here David. here I'm going to explain my experience in Perspectivve and what is my role in it.

# Personal experience in the company & role

Personally, Perspectivve web development department is very flexible and need to adapt the needs of the customer. If the customer want a quick landsite, we use ASTRO.js, if the customer want a e-commerce, then we use Next.JS.

My main role in Perspectivve is Web development and UI/UX designer. Honestly, my role as a designer is not that present in the job since I directly code the desire design and tested it out locally and then builded the production.
