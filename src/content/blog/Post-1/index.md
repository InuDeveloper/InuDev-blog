## Hi, Here Charles David

I'm going to explain how I became a software developer, and some tips to become a better one.

When I was 12, I started with C++ as my first language, as I started developing terminal applications to do basic math. I even created a Covid detector in the terminal using C++, a lot of nested if/else

After understanding how computers works, I started doing HTML + CSS + JavaScript websites. They weren't beautiful as I didn't knew how to.

At my 14th birthday, I started getting more into React.js framework for web development and then Next.Js.

and from my 15th until nowadays, I do from websites, web apps to mobile and desktop applications. I work with JavaScript and TypeScript as my main languages, and I enjoy learning new things to solve personal problems.
I started doing a project called DogPath, a organized ToDo list to keep track of the developer's project.

## Tips as a developer I learn in my path of learning code

### 1. Embrace your mistakes

As a developer, we need to adapt quickly and learn quickly as the technologies evolve. I learn to embrace the mistakes I do, as breaking a website code, deleting a data from a database
or just destroying my computer. Is okay, as we learn from our mistakes. Mistakes are the best teachers in the life.

### 2. Read documentation & take notes

As we do at school and university, reading documentation and taking notes as we learn new topics help us memorize the information and keep it longer in our mind. Documentation also can help you understand why "x" error is ocurring
and the note taking can help you if you forget something just go straight to your  notes and seek for information yourself made.

Is important to know how to take notes, I will explain further how I take tech notes as a indie software developer in another blog.

### 3. Make your own blog & join communities

As we learn new topics, is fun to teach others, and share our knowledge and get feedback. Don't take anything personal. Getting feedback of your work can help you to improve it as
you work it. Exmaple, any project you started try to ask any friend to tell you if it looks good, what function they would put, ask them to try it too, etc.

## Concluding
