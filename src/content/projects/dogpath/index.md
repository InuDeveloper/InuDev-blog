Hey, Charles David here. I've been working in this new project called DogPath. Inspired from Takuya Matsuyama's Inkdrop note taking app. DogPath is going to be fully released in desktop at Q4 of 2024. and Q1 of 2025.

DogPath is being programmed with JavaScript, using the framework **Electron**. Including other tools, like Tailwind CSS for the style and Webpack to help the integration of extra tools. **DogPath mission is**: help developer organize their projects. The app offer a simple and sloppy design, easy to learn. Using Markdown to take notes and make descriptions in the list.
