Hi, here David. I am working on a landing page for a business called Voltagene SRL

Voltagene SRL website is still under heavy development and the repository is privatized. Voltagene SRL is a solar panel installation business in Dominican Republic, their website is made with ASTRO.js, mostly JavaScript but also with TypeScript and the framework for the styling is Tailwind CSS.

Also, for optimization and making the website more slappy, I decided to add SolidJs.
