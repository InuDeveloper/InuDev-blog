Hi, here David. I am working on a landing page for a business called Voltagene SRL

Voltagene SRL website is still under heavy development and the repository is privatized.

## Stages

### Template selection and design

Voltagene SRL is following a minimalistic and simple design. Some components has been taken from public templates like ASTRO-SPHERE

### Configuration files

After finishing with the design configuration and tailwind CSS installation, I move on to the configuration files like `consts.ts`
